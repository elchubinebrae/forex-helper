Project Forex Helper

Description:
This is the forex helper, with hundreds of pairs to choose from scrolling though tonnes and tonnes of charts is boring,
I've created a quick over view of the markets to give some heads up as to which charts you will want to be looking at.

It's useful for beginners to locate trending stocks, if somethings going sideways no one wants to jump in, if it's trending up across
all timeframes then you get a better idea of the general direction.

Installation:

Uses requests, pandas and yfinance. I will add a requirements.txt file soon but any level of install will work.
