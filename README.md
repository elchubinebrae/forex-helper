I had a bit of a dip into the forex market and one of the things i quickly found was I was looking for pairs that had some good starting points.

So I pulled a load of data from yfinance, applied some mathmateical transformations to understand the whole slope across different time frames.

The resulting DataFrame shows which pairs are positively trending and you can easily navigate tot hem using your favourite chart mapping tool.
